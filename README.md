[] When clicked, each door should have a unique movie behind it based on the theme for that month.
[] Opened doors should present the user with information about the film such as the title, year of release, age rating in the UK, the cast and description. This information should be called from an API
[] Opened doors should also show a trailer for the film to convince people to watch the film.
[] Once the door modal is closed the picture for that film should show on the door to represent that it has already been "opened"

Stretch goal
[] The user should have their activity saved to local storage so that they can come back and it doesn't reset the doors that have already been opened
[] User needs to see an animation when the door is opened
